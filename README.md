# Basic Ray Tracer
This is my first attempt at a basic ray tracer.

##Build
You will need Visual Studio 2013 to build this with the supplied solution files.
This project depends on the [GLM math library](http://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.7/index.html) 
You will need to set up the project include directory to point to where you have GLM saved.
